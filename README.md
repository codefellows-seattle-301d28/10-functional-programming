# Functional Programming

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This application displays articles on a page from a database, although in this iteration it creates that database from an included JSON file. It allows for simple navigation from home, to a 'New Article' page that allows for a user to enter article information into a form that will immediately populate the home page. It also includes an admin page which displays statistics on the articles therein.

## Getting Started
To get this app running, a user would need to have a server running on their local machine (in our case, postgres SQL), utilize Node Package Manager with installed dependencies, and clone the repository to their machine. After running nodemon and ensuring a connection to a database of choice, they would simply head to their localhost in browser and check it all out! Any changes in the articles available would be done manually in the JSON file, or entered in the 'New Article' form page.

## Architecture
This application utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars, NPM and PostgreSQL.
